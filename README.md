# SQL (Structured Query Language)
I will load practices executed by me related to the course "SQL for Data Science" from EDX

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment using Jupyter notebooks.

Syllabus

### Module 1 - Introduction to Databases
Introduction to databases and relational concepts. Creation of a database instance on the cloud. 
- A database is a repository of data.
- A set of software tools for the data in the database is called DBMS (Database Management System).
- RBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data.
- I learned some advantages :+1: of using cloud databases
:heavy_minus_sign: cloud databases can expand an shrink their storage and compute capacities during runtime to accomodate changing needs and usage demands;
:heavy_minus_sign: scalability | ease of use, users can access from cirtually anywhere;
:heavy_minus_sign: disaster recovery | data is kept secure through backups on remote servers in case of failure or power outage.

- There are 5 basic SQL commands: Create, Insert, Select, Update, Delete.
- I created an IBM Db2 database instance on cloud.
