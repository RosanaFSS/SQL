# SQL (Structured Query Language)
I will load practices executed by me related to the course "SQL for Data Science" from EDX
It is available at https://www.edx.org/course/sql-for-data-science
This course is part of a Professional Certificate. It is a free course and it is possible to get certificate after doing some tests and paying R$ 199.

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment using Jupyter notebooks.

Below I share my summary

### Module 1 - Introduction to Databases
_18 Dec 2020_ \
Day09  **#60daysofUdacity**\
Introduction to databases and relational concepts. Creation of a database instance on the cloud. 

- A database is a repository of data.
- A set of software tools for the data in the database is called DBMS (Database Management System).
- RBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data.
- I learned some advantages :+1: of using cloud databases
:heavy_minus_sign: cloud databases can expand an shrink their storage and compute capacities during runtime to accomodate changing needs and usage demands;
:heavy_minus_sign: scalability | ease of use, users can access from cirtually anywhere;
:heavy_minus_sign: disaster recovery | data is kept secure through backups on remote servers in case of failure or power outage.

- There are 5 basic SQL commands: Create, Insert, Select, Update, Delete.

- An Entity Relationship data model, or ER data model, is an alternative to a relational data model.
- In the ER model, entities are objects that exist independently of any other entities.
- Entities have attributes which are the data elements that characterize the entity.
- Attributes are certain properties or characteristics of an entity and tell us more about the entity.
- A table is a combination of rows and columns.
- Common data types include characters such as Char and Varchar, numbers such as integer.

- Hands-on Lab | I created an IBM Cloud account and provision for a Database instance on cloud with  DB2 Lite Plan.
